Power BI dashboard and Executive Summary for a pet food supply company
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I was asked to uncover insights into the company's overall performance and possible improvement opportunities.

I used company’s data located in four CSV files.

The company had two primary business goals:
1.	 to serve as many customers as possible and increase sales. 
2.	 to reduce its operating expenses. 

Ad. 1
For sales growth, I focused on upsell and cross-sell opportunities. In a cross-sell, you promote a relevant product at the point of purchase. 
For example, when a customer is ready to buy a beach umbrella, present an offer on beach chairs. In an upsell, you promote a higher-priced alternative or a higher quantity of a product. 
For example, when a customer buys pet food regularly, present an offer on organic food.
Ad.2 
For shipping cost reductions, I explored some of the following alternatives: 
- Consolidating multiple shipments into a single one. 
- Reducing package size dimensions and weight. 
- Shipping a higher quantity of a product.

I have done market basket analysis to find products frequently bought together in a single checkout. 

I built a data model in Power BI, created metrics for customers and orders.
I built dashboard-style pages to present shipping costs by region and product and a what-if analysis dashboard-style page to present the impact of shipping higher product quantities on sales and profitability.
I also built interactive dashboard-style pages for executives and provided specific business recommendations.
The company’s executives could easily explore key KPIs and drill down into the details, such as sales, customers, and expenses. 
This enabled the company to make more informed decisions about future cross-sell promotions, logistics related to shipping items, and further ways to reduce their operating costs.
